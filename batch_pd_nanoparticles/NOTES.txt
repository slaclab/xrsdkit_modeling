Many samples have a superlattice that is difficult to fit. 
May have mixed disordered/crystalline character.
Large lattice parameter leads to potential memory overflow.
These samples should be left without the "good_fit" flag,
until we find a good way to fit them.

Some samples are not done. TODO: finish.

There are some without the "good_fit" flag. TODO: re-inspect.

Some samples are not done.
Suspiciously high count of samples without the "good_fit" flag. TODO: re-inspect.
